### Output / logs

Please also include any output from Terraform or Ansible that you feel is relevant - and if Splunk is misbehaving, please include relevant lines from Splunk's log (found at `/opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log` on the spawned instances).

Wrapping them in [code tags](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#quoting-code) will ensure that they are readable in the issue.
